# Converge — Founders README

Welcome to **Converge**. This document aligns founders and early builders on **what we’re building, why it matters, and how we execute**. If you’re joining the project, read this first.

---

## 1) What is Converge?

**Converge** is a QR-based, mobile-friendly web app that helps event organizers **drive and measure meaningful networking** at workshops, roundtables, and conferences—without requiring attendees to download an app.

**One-liner:**  
> Converge turns passive events into measurable, high-quality networking experiences.

---

## 2) Why We’re Building This

### The pain
- Events claim “networking,” but organizers can’t measure engagement.
- Attendees often don’t know who to talk to or how to follow up.
- Existing event apps are heavy, expensive, and rarely adopted.

### Our insight
- **No-download, QR-first experiences** have far higher adoption at live events.
- Gamification + simple tracking nudges people to have more, better conversations.
- Organizers value **measurable engagement** (who met whom, at what scale).

---

## 3) Who This Is For (ICP)

**Primary ICP (early traction):**
- Universities & student organizations  
- Startup workshops, demo days, roundtable events

**Secondary ICP (expansion):**
- Meetups & community groups  
- Conferences with breakouts  
- Career networking events

---

## 4) Product Principles (Non-Negotiables)

1. **Zero-download UX**  
   Browser-first. If it needs an app install, we’re doing it wrong.

2. **10-second interactions**  
   Logging a conversation must be faster than pulling out Instagram.

3. **Privacy by default**  
   No public emails. Minimal data. Notes are short and optional.

4. **Engagement > vanity metrics**  
   We reward meaningful interactions, not just check-ins.

5. **Operational simplicity**  
   Organizers should be able to run Converge with 1 person on-site.

---

## 5) MVP Scope (What We Ship First)

**Attendees**
- QR check-in → ref code + QR
- Log conversations (scan partner QR or manual ref)
- Topic tags + short note
- Optional personal score view

**Organizers**
- Admin dashboard
- Participants + logs view
- Leaderboard + top 3 winners
- CSV export
- Soft-delete spam logs

**Explicitly out of scope for MVP**
- Native apps  
- Payments  
- Deep analytics  
- CRM integrations

---

## 6) How We Measure Success

**Event-level**
- ≥70% of attendees check in
- ≥50% log at least 2 conversations
- Median time to log ≤10 seconds
- <2% spam after moderation

**Product-level**
- Organizers reuse Converge for a second event
- Referrals to other clubs/organizers
- Positive post-event feedback (NPS ≥ 8)

---

## 7) Go-To-Market (Early)

**Phase 1: Campus wedge**
- Run pilots with student orgs and university programs
- Offer Converge free for early adopters
- Collect testimonials + case studies

**Phase 2: Templates for common event types**
- “Startup roundtables”
- “Career networking night”
- “Mentor office hours”

**Phase 3: Expand beyond campus**
- Meetups, accelerators, small conferences

---

## 8) Monetization (Later, Not MVP)

We don’t charge for MVP pilots. The goal is usage + learning.

**Future pricing ideas**
- Free: limited events/month
- Pro: unlimited events + branding + analytics
- Enterprise: SSO, integrations, sponsor dashboards

---

## 9) Risks & How We Handle Them

**Risk: Low adoption at events**  
→ Solve with QR posters, MC reminders, and prizes.

**Risk: Cheating / fake logs**  
→ Pair-window rules, verified partners, admin moderation.

**Risk: Privacy concerns**  
→ Minimal data collection, no public emails, short notes.

**Risk: Feature creep**  
→ MVP discipline. Ship small. Validate before expanding.

---

## 10) What “Good” Looks Like (Bar for Quality)

- A first-time attendee can check in and log a conversation **without instructions**.
- Organizers can run Converge with **no training**.
- The leaderboard feels fair and credible to participants.
- The product feels lightweight, not “enterprise software.”

---

## 11) Operating Cadence (Early Team)

- Weekly shipping: small, usable improvements
- Every event = product feedback loop
- After each pilot:
  - What broke?
  - Where did users hesitate?
  - What did organizers ask for?

---

## 12) Decision-Making Framework

When deciding features:
1. Does this reduce friction at the event?
2. Does this increase meaningful engagement?
3. Will this matter to organizers enough to pay later?

If “no” to any → deprioritize.

---

## 13) Culture & Values (How We Build)

- **User-first pragmatism**: real-world event constraints > perfect architecture  
- **Speed with taste**: ship fast, but don’t ship ugly UX  
- **Evidence over opinions**: pilots decide roadmap  
- **Respect privacy**: treat user data like it’s ours

---

## 14) Short-Term Roadmap (Next 30–60 Days)

- Nail QR check-in + partner QR scan
- Make leaderboard trustworthy
- Improve reliability on weak Wi-Fi
- Package “event setup in 5 minutes”
- Publish 2 campus case studies

---

## 15) Long-Term Vision

Converge becomes the **default lightweight engagement layer for in-person events**:
- Plug into any workshop, conference, or networking format
- Turn “networking” from a vague promise into measurable outcomes
- Provide organizers with simple, actionable insights about engagement

---

## 16) How to Contribute (For New Teammates)

- Start by improving **time-to-first-log**
- Fix the top 3 friction points observed at the last event
- Keep features small and shippable
- Document decisions in the repo

---

**If you’re reading this as a founder:**  
Your job is to protect the simplicity of Converge. Every added feature must earn its place by making events *meaningfully better*.
